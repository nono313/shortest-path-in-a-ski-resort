###Objective
Create a graph by parsing a text file representing a ski resort with stations as vertices and tracks as edges.<br>
Compute the shortest path between two points on the maps with the possibility of not using every types of roads (e.g : no black tracks).

###Implementation
Two algorithms for shortest paths computations are implemented in this project : Dijkstra's and Floyd Warshall's.
